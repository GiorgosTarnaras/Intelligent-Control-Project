# Intelligent Control- Team Project  Learning Agile Maneuvers for a 3D Quadrotor
 Our goal for this project is to use reinforcement learning to train a simulated quadro
tor to perform agile maneuvers such as flips, dives, or slalom navigation. Quadrotor
 helicopters are an emerging rotorcraft concept for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plat
forms. The vehicle consists of four rotors in total, with two pairs of counter-rotating,
 f
 ixed-pitch blades located at the four corners of the aircraft. Due to its specific capa
bilities, the use of autonomous quadrotor vehicles has been envisaged for a variety of
 applications both as individual vehicles and in multiple vehicle teams, including surveil
lance, search and rescue and mobile sensor networks.
